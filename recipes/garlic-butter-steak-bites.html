      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        Garlic butter steak bites are tender, juicy pieces of steak seared to
        perfection and coated in a rich, buttery garlic sauce. Cooked quickly in
        a hot skillet, they develop a flavorful crust while staying succulent
        inside.

          <strong>Steak:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds sirloin, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 cup sliced mushrooms</li>
            <li>1/2 cup 1/2-inch-thick onion slices</li>
            <li>
              1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley, plus more for garnish
              (optional)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Combine coconut aminos, red wine vinegar, 1 tablespoon olive oil,
          salt, and pepper in a large resealable plastic bag. Seal and gently
          squeeze to mix.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add steak pieces to the marinade, remove air, and seal. Move the steak
          around to coat evenly. Refrigerate for 15 to 20 minutes (no longer
          than 1 hour).
        </li>
        <li>
          Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a microwave-safe dish, stir in minced
          garlic, and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Drain marinade from steak and gently blot pieces with paper towels.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat remaining butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat until
          sizzling.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place steak pieces in a single layer and sear until browned, about 1
          to 2 minutes per side. Cook in batches if necessary. Remove steak from
          skillet, tent with foil, and set aside to rest.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add mushrooms and onions to the same skillet. Stir frequently for
          about 2 minutes until they begin to brown. Add 2 tablespoons water if
          the skillet is dry and reduce heat to medium.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add garlic butter to the skillet and cook until vegetables are tender,
          about 3 to 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Return steak and accumulated juices to the skillet, stirring to coat
          everything in the garlic butter.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sprinkle parsley over the dish and remove from heat. Garnish with
          additional fresh parsley if desired.
        </li>
      </ol>
